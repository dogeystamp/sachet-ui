# sachet-ui

This is the frontend for [Sachet](https://github.com/dogeystamp/sachet-server), a small file-sharing service.

## development

Clone the repo:

    git clone https://github.com/dogeystamp/sachet-ui
    cd sachet-ui

Install dependencies:

    npm install

Serve the frontend on localhost (rebuilds on refresh):

    npm run serve

Or, build the frontend and output to `dist/`:
    
    npm run build

Then, connect to `http://localhost:8000`.
The [backend](https://github.com/dogeystamp/sachet-server) must be running for the web app to work.
